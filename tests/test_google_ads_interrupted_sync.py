        Scenario: A sync job is interrupted. The state is saved with `currently_syncing`.
                  The next sync job kicks off and the tap picks back up on that `currently_syncing` stream.

        Expected State Structure:
            state = {'currently_syncing': ('<stream-name2>', '<customer-id>'),
            'bookmarks': {
                '<stream-name1>': {'<customer-id>': {'<replication-key>': <completed-bookmark-value>}},
                '<stream-name2>': {'<customer-id>': {'<replication-key>': <incomplete-bookmark-value>}},

        Test Cases:
         - Verify an interrupted sync can resume based on the `currently_syncing` and stream level bookmark value.
         - Verify only records with replication-key values greater than or equal to the stream level bookmark are
           replicated on the resuming sync for the interrupted stream.
         - Verify the yet-to-be-synced streams are replicated following the interrupted stream in the resuming sync.
             (All yet-to-be-synced streams must replicate before streams that were already synced. - covered by unittests)

        NOTE: The following streams all had records for the dates used in this test. If needed they can be used in
              testing cases like this in the future.

        Scenario: A sync job is interrupted for full table stream. The state is saved with `currently_syncing`
                    and `last_pk_fetched`(id of last synced record).
                  The next sync job kicks off, the tap picks only remaining records for interrupted stream and complete the sync.

        Expected State Structure:
            state = {'currently_syncing': ('<stream-name2>', '<customer-id>'),
            'bookmarks': {
                '<stream-name2>': {'<customer-id>': {last_pk_fetched: <incomplete-bookmark-value>}},

        Test Cases:
            - Verify that id of 1st record in interrupted sync is greater than or equal to last_pk_fetched.
            - Verify that all records in the full sync and interrupted sync come in Ascending order.
            - Verify interrupted_sync has the fewer records as compared to full sync
            - Verify state is flushed if sync is completed.
            - Verify resuming sync replicates all records for streams that were yet-to-be-synced
